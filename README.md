## Snake Game

The `snake_game.py` script is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame. To run the game, first install the `pygame` package:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Then execute the script:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
